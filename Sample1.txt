Editing this file and trying to pull it to local. 
Git pull is working successfully
Now make changes to the file and open the same file in local and see if the changes are there. 
The changes should not be there and we need to pull the same to local to see the changes reflecting. 

Changes are reflecting when the file is modified directly in Git Hub and pulled in local 

Now trying another scenario by editing this file in local and tryin to push the same to see it reflecting in Git Hub
